# Workshop_2017
## Repository for models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2017 Workshop.

The 2017 workshop will focus on hands-on activities.

Laptop software installations should be done either prior to the first day or in the evening after the first day.

Initial pipeline overview will contain:

* BNG / RuleBender
* Compartmental BioNetGen
* Import into CellBlender and run with MCell
* Comparison with BioNetGen model
* Replace primitive geometries with CellOrganizer and run in CellBlender/MCell again

This repository has been created as a place to work out and share the components of this pipeline.
