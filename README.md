# Workshop_2017
## Repository for models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2017 Workshop.

The 2017 workshop will focus on hands-on activities. Students are encouraged to use the classroom computers (especially on the first day) in order to eliminate any class time used for software installation issues. Laptop software installations should be done either prior to the first day or in the evening after the first day.

Initial pipeline overview will contain:

* BNG / RuleBender
* Compartmental BioNetGen
* Import into CellBlender and run with MCell
* Comparison with BioNetGen model
* Replace primitive geometries with CellOrganizer and run in CellBlender/MCell again

This repository has been created as a place to work out and share the components of this pipeline. The following directories contain support files for each tool:

* **[BioNetGen](bionetgen)**
* **[CellBlender](cellblender)**
* **[CellOrganizer](cellorganizer)**
* **[MCell](mcell)**
